<h2>What is The Stanleys?</h2>
<p>
  <em>The Stanleys</em> is an artful representation of the growing
  international culture curiosity of young adults. Our objective
  is simple, help others to achieve international cultural
  awareness. We will be the first 100% community owned project and
  will harness the power of the community to generate profits and
  share them with the members.
</p>
<p>
  The first art models were created by teens in our circle of
  families and friends. These models became the foundation of
  unique characters that we hope you find interesting and playful,
  as we do.
</p>
<p>
  Come visit us and experience a sincere and safe environment.

<h2>Why did we create The Stanleys?</h2>
<p>
  Our team has been traveling throughout the world since we can
  remember and live in various countries throughout North
  America, Europe, and Asia. When we reflect on what triggered
  our cultural curiosity, most of us can clearly recollect the
  experience our kids had when completing the "Flat Stanley"
  project in their early school years. The excitement they
  showed when getting responses from all over the world was
  priceless. We realized this was a significant crossroad in the
  lives of our kids.

<h2>Who are The Stanleys?</h2>
<p>
  We do not have a "Flat Stanley" to share with the crypto
  community. Instead, our friends and family came up with their
  own characters to share with the world. Meet
  <em>The Stanleys</em>.
</p>
<p>
  <em>The Stanleys</em> have lived by the river since
  the beginning of time and have always shown an interest in
  traveling, experiencing different cultures and trying new
  foods. Recently they have struck it lucky trading meme coins
  and are now travelling the world with their friends, taking
  selfies at interesting locations, and having fun.

  <h2>The Roadmap</h2>

    The initial roadmap is based on a simple launch providing

    owned NFT.

    We recognized <em>The Stanleys</em> potential to continue being
